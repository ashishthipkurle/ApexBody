# ApexBody

This project is the ApexBody Flutter app. Below are quick steps to generate launcher icons from the bundled logo.

Generate launcher icons (uses `assets/ApexBody_logo.png`):

```bash
flutter pub get; flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

If you prefer to set icons manually, replace the platform icon files under `android/app/src/main/res/`, `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`, and the Windows/macOS icon resources.
